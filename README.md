Note: You do not need to submit hard copies.

Goals:

‚Ä¢ To learn how to implement the concept of ‚ÄúFlow of Control‚Äù in C++.

‚Ä¢ To write a very simple C++ program.

Description:

You have just purchased a stereo system that costs $1000 on the following credit plan: no down payment, an interest rate of 18% per year (and hence 1.5% per month), and monthly payments of $50. The monthly payment of $50 is used to pay the interest, and whatever is left is used to pay part of the remaining debt. Hence, the first month you pay 1.5% of $1000 in interest. That is $15 in interest. The remaining $35 is deducted from your debt, which leaves you with a debt of $965.00. The next month you pay interest of 1.5% of $965.00, which is $14.48. Hence, you can deduct $35.52 (which is $50‚Äì$14.48) from the amount you owe.

Here is a sample dialog (where the user input is depicted as Bold, but you do not need to display user input in bold.):

********************************************************

ItTotal takes interest 29 months paid to is: pay $312.98 off the loan.

Special Cases:

1. Please think about how to deal with the last payment, which is smaller than regular payment. For example, in the above table, the regular payments are $80.00 whereas the last payment is only 72.98.

2. Your program needs to ensure that regular payments are greater than any monthly interest. For example, in the above amortization table, your program must test if the regular monthly payment (i.e., $80.00) is larger than the monthly interest (e.g., $20.00 in the first month), otherwise your program should ask for a larger monthly payment.

3. Make sure that the loan amount and monthly payment are positive numbers and interest rate is a non-negative number.
